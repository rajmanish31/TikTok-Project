# TikTok Project
This end to end course project is part of Google Advanced Data Analytics course on coursera.

## Project goal:
The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

## Background:
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic contentâ€“where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

## Scenario:
As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, with new considerations from the leadership team, you will create a project proposal by assigning the required data analytical tasks into realistic milestones that will advise future steps in the claims classification project.

This project is done in several steps:

### Step 1: Inspect and analyze data
In this step, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Understand the situation
* Prepare to understand and organize the provided tiktok dataset ([2017 Yellow TaxiTrip Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs)) and information.

#### Part 2: Understand the data
* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.
* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps.

#### Part 3: Understand the variables
* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into specific variables.

### Step 2: Exploratory data analysis
In this step, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. You will also design a professional data visualization that tells a story, and will help data-driven decisions for business needs.

This step has 4 parts:

#### Part 1: Imports, links, and loading

####  Part 2: Data Exploration
* Data cleaning

#### Part 3: Building visualizations

#### Part 4: Evaluate and share results

### Step 3: Data exploration and hypothesis testing
In this step, you will explore the data provided and conduct a hypothesis testing.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Imports and data loading
* What data packages will be necessary for hypothesis testing?

#### Part 2: Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing
* How did computing descriptive statistics help you analyze your data?
* How did you formulate your null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?

#### Part 3: Communicate insights with stakeholders
* What key business insight(s) emerged from your A/B test?
* What business recommendations do you propose based on your results?

### Step 4: Regression modeling
In this step, you will build a logistic regression model in Python. Logistic regression helps you estimate the probability of an outcome.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions
* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a logistic regression model?

#### Part 2: Model Building and evaluation
* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?

#### Part 3: Interpreting Model Results
* What key insights emerged from your model(s)?
* What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?

### Step 5: Classifying videos using machine learning
In this step, you will practice using machine learning techniques to predict on a binary outcome variable.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Ethical considerations
* Consider the ethical implications of the request
* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

#### Part 2: Feature engineering
* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

#### Part 3: Modeling
* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
